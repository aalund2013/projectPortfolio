| Project Name    | Project Description        | Repository Link |
|:----------------|:---------------------------|:---------------:|
| Golf Enhancer   | The intent of this project was to create an application to use machine learning and computer vision to analyze a golfer's stance and swings and provide feedback on how to improve. | https://github.com/aalund2013/GolfEnhancer |
| Tank Wars       | This two-player game was part of a team project and was built using the Python Arcade library. Our application was voted best in class, best graphics and best sound effects. | https://github.com/aalund2013/cse210-project |
| Restful APIs    | Utilized MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, Node.js, Swagger, and Heroku in both personal and team assignments. | https://github.com/aalund2013/cse341-node-prj2 & https://github.com/aalund2013/cse-341-finalProject |
| ClearRoutes | ClearRoutes is an Android application written in Kotlin that combines weather forecasts with route planning and navigation. | https://github.com/aalund2013/ClearRoutesFinal|
| Department and Student Trackers | My first real project began in Excel where I utilized VBA and macros to automate routine tasks, summarize student data, and track and report metrics to a manager dashboard. While I do not have access to the code or workbook anymore, this project was influential in both the department I worked in and in my own personal and professional development.||
